Core goals:

- Compilation:
   - Compilation at the core of the language
   - Fine grained incremental compilation
   - Optimisations part of the language, not the compiler
   - Program validaion at compilation
- Expressivness:
   - Algorithms should only need to be written once.
   - Simple ideas should be concise.
   - Abstractions should be easy to read.
- Speed and memory:
   - It should be easy to write code as efficient as C
   - It should be easy to optimise code

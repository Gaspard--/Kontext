Core goals:

-> Compilation:
   -> Compilation at the core of the language
   -> Fine grained incremental compilation
   -> Optimisations part of the language, not the compiler
-> Expressivness:
   -> Algorithms only need to be written twice.
   -> Simple stuff should be concise.
-> Speed and memory:
   -> It should be possible to write code as efficient as C
   -> It should be possible to optimise code
